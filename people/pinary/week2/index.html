      <p>This week could be the most exciting, and fun week I had so far at MIT! I literally felt like I am a first year student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and studying a variety of magical specialties to build cool stuff!</p>

<p>Before I dig into details, I would like to shout out to <b>Tom</b>: he was super helpful and patient while I was asking all kinds of questions and doing all kinds of rookie mistakes throughout the entire week! <b>John</b> was also super helpful, and gave us an intro to laser cutting at the beginning of the week, and later taught me a lot of cool tricks about Coreldraw when using the vinyl cutter.</p>

<p>I was actually pretty scared the first day when John was showing us the machines – I’ve never even seen a laser cutter before let alone using it (or any other fabrication machine for that matter), and never used any designing tool like Rhino, Coreldraw or even Photoshop… So both for laser cutting, and for the vinyl assignments I had no idea how to take project ideas in my mind into an actual product. I was literally feeling like the following:</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/draw_owl.jpg" alt="Owl" /></p>

<p>After an initial period of frustration, the next day I decided to take things from <b>finish</b> to <b>start</b>: <i>If I were to already had a design, could I print it using these machines in the first place?</i> Laser cutter seemed more scary than the vinyl (probably due to the size of the machine and the word ‘laser’ giving me a more dangerous vibe) I decided to test vinyl cutter. Tom already showed us how to use the vinyl cutter the day before, and did a test print; so I decided to replicate the same experiment. Since I didn’t know how to use Coreldraw, I decided to use <a href="http://mods.cba.mit.edu/">CBA Mods</a> for printing. Mods in general was a super useful and simple to use tool since it handles many details itself and you just need to worry about adjusting the machine settings. The simpliest way to use the vinyl cutter to print something was roughly as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Insert the printing paper under the rollers (but make sure that both rollers are under the white labels, otherwise the machine will complain about ‘bad positioning’)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn on the machine -&gt; Select <b>Piece</b> option -&gt; Press Enter and let the machine figure out the size of the paper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open <a href="http://mods.cba.mit.edu/">mods.cba.mit.edu</a> (also make sure the printing server is running; if not, start it from the shortcut on the desktop) and select ‘open server program’ -&gt; ‘vinyl cutter’ -&gt; ‘cut png’ (somehow uploading svg never really worked..) -&gt; <b>Select png file</b> -&gt; Adjust <b>Force</b> to 80 and <b>Speed</b> to 20 -&gt; Click Print (but make sure your image is within the size of the paper!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voila! I was able to print the Matryoshka sticker Tom printed earlier, I am super happy!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/vinyl_test.jpg" alt="Matryoshka" /></p>

<p>Next, I decided to try my chances at laser cutter. This process turned out to be super easy using the CBA Mods as well; similar to vinyl cutter, the process of printing something was as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Open <a href="http://mods.cba.mit.edu/">mods.cba.mit.edu</a> and select <b>open server program</b> -&gt; <b>Epilog</b> -&gt; <b>cut png</b> -&gt; <b>Select png file</b> -&gt; Adjust <b>Power</b> to 100, <b>Speed</b> to 20, and <b>Rate</b> to 200 -&gt; Click Print!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was super happy to print the following Rhino (and I actually carried it around the whole day to show it to everyone!)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/laser_test.jpg" alt="Rhino" /></p>

<h2 id="rhino">Rhino</h2>

<p>Now I was feeling that I am ready to dig into more detail: how can I create my own design to print? After talking to some people in the lab, it seemed like two programs were popular in designing stuff: <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com/">Rhino</a> and <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion</a>. I decided to go with Rhino, and watched the following tutorials which were super helpful to get familiar with Rhino (and also get a feeling of what functionalities exist in CAD programs): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPgMccdh8QU">Introduction to Rhino Interface</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Deebb6WZQ">2D Drawing in Rhino</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Deebb6WZQ">Introduction to 2D Rhinoceros</a>. After watching these videos, I learned tons of useful stuff that I can use for drawing simple shapes. Overall, I really liked Rhino because I can just type commands to its command line interface. The most important commands I learned are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Join</b>: concatenate objects</li>
  <li><b>Trim</b>: trim out extra stuff you don’t want</li>
  <li><b>Invert</b>: selects everything else</li>
  <li><b>Split </b>: split objects based on <i>cutting object</i></li>
  <li><b>Move</b>: move objects with precision, e.g. to end or middle of the objects</li>
  <li><b>Mirror</b>: mirror objects along any direction you want (very useful when desiging a complicated object; you can just design left part and mirror it to the right)</li>
  <li><b>Dim</b>: measure dimension of the objects (very useful especially testing out different kerf widths)</li>
  <li><b>BooleanDifference</b>: substract one object from the other</li>
  <li><b>Chamfer and Fillet</b>: different corner styles</li>
  <li><b>Explode</b>: divide objects into parts</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things about Rhino:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you do selection via mouse from left to right; it will only select objects that is completely contained within the object. From right to left: it will select anything touching the box.</li>
  <li><b>Smart track</b>: a super useful feature where you can just track the coordinates by hovering on objects.</li>
  <li>When using Rhino, be careful about the version mismatch. Probably you are using the latest version, 5.0 but the lab computers have 4.0. So you have to export your design to Rhino 4.0 format to print from the lab computers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="laser-cutting">Laser Cutting</h2>

<p>After designing some simple shapes, I decided to design something more complex. Inspired by <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Press-fit-Construction-Kit/">this</a> press-fit construction kit, I designed the following:</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/laser_puzzle.jpg" alt="Rhino" /></p>

<p>The key part in this design was to make sure the kerfs are the same size with the width of the cardboard (and actually, I had to make the kerf a bit smaller than the actual width of the cardboard to accomodate for the small amount laser cutter takes away). In particular, I made the kerf width 4.2mm (and cardboard width was 4.3mm – as I measured with the ruler) and it seems to fit okay (although maybe I could make it a little bit smaller).</p>

<p>In order to make the kerfs parameterized, I used Grasshopper with Rhino. Grasshopper is a seperate software that comes with Rhino – but actually you need to install Rhino Work in Progress (RhinoWIP) version to be able to use Grasshopper.  I really liked <a href="https://vimeopro.com/rhino/grasshopper-getting-started-by-david-rutten/video/79844992">Grasshopper Getting Started</a> lecture series to learn Grasshopper.</p>

<p>After playing with the puzzle pieces for a while, I decided to design something else that I can actually use: a jewelry stand. I noticed that people are usually printing jewelry ‘trees’, but I wanted to go for something more radical: octopus! I draw the design in Rhino and I think it worked pretty well (I used polyline feature in Rhino to draw ‘freehand’ octopus arms, but it would be nice to create these arms in a mathematical way):</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/octopus_before.jpg" alt="Octo1" /></p>

<p>And here is the video of cutting the octopus head:</p>

<p>And this is the final product with my jewelry on it!</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/octopus_after.jpg" alt="Octo2" /></p>

<p>For the group project, we (Thomas, Oscar, Sean and George) tried to print shapes with different kerf sizes but somehow every time we tried to print, the laser cutter ended up burning the cardboard (Tom couldn’t figure out what was wrong with the machine as well – so it was an unfortunate experiment for us). But here is a picture from our group meeting where Tom explains Vinyl cutter once more! (the picture is shamelessly stolen from  <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/4.140/CBA/people/oscarrosello/index.html">Oscar</a>’s Week 2 blog post)</p>

<h2 id="vinyl-cutting">Vinyl Cutting</h2>

<p>I was super excited to learn that we can print on t-shirts using the vinyl cutter (with a heat transfer paper). Given that Halloween is around the corner, I was eyeing for potential maternity Halloween costumes (given that nothing else will fit me anyway!). I came across <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ieJgP">this</a> super-cute baby skeleton picture and decided to design a maternity t-shirt with this. The most difficult part was to extract the design of this image into a vectorized form. I was only familiar with Gimp but only enough to just cut/resize images. I first tried to clean-up the image using ‘select by color’ feature and removed all black pieces. But I only ended up with an image where corners are super frizzy (and non-vectorized). I decided to give it a shot anyways, and printed it as a laptop sticker but it really looked crappy:</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/bad_skeleton.jpg" alt="Octo2" /></p>

<p>After struggling for a while, I learned from <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/4.140/CBA/people/emilysa/">Emily</a> that Adobe Illustrator has this amazing feature called <b>Image Trace</b>! I simply imported the picture I want to extract the skeleton shape from, and selected number of colors (2) and the rest was taken care by the Image Trace. I still cleaned up the image a bit but everything was completely vectorized and ready to go! I printed the design by exporting the file to SVG in Adobe Illustrator, and importing it to Coreldraw. I used heat-transfer paper that was available at the lab. After printing the stickers, the next step was to use the iron press to transfer it to the t-shirt. As always, Tom helped me and taught how to use the ironing machine:</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/vinyl_tee_1.jpg" alt="Octo2" /></p>

<p>Since I wanted a pink ribbon on the baby’s head and a heart in the upper part; I printed those seperately onto a pink heat-transfer paper and transferred them to the t-shirt after I printed the skeleton parts. Here is the final product:</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/vinylcutter_small.png" alt="Octo2" /></p>

<p>and here it is in action:</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/vinyl_tee_2.jpg" alt="Octo2" /></p>

<p>The stupid mistake I did was: when you print it with heat-transfer paper, you actually end up mirroring the image. So I ended up with a heart on the right :) But I am so happy with the final product and didn’t had any more white papers anyway.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to print something for my future-daughter – to be named Ada after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/classes/4.140/CBA/people/pinary/assets/img/vinyl_tee_3.jpg" alt="Octo2" /></p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>John really stressed this enough number of times during the training, but I end up doing the same mistake over and over again: make sure your designs are hairline thickness. If you are printing your design, but laser is not really cutting the cardboard; this might be the reason why.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you change the large cardboards with small (10 x 10 inch) ones, make sure to adjust your pane in Coreldraw accordingly! (The default one is 36 x 24 inch – the dimensions of the large cardboard).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the laser cutter’s head was super low and overlapping with the cardboard (to a point that the head is rotated 90 degrees). Not sure why this is happening, and even though we tried to restart the machine or reset it from the control panel, nothing really fixed the issue. To fix this, you can use the control panel on the laser cutter; Press XY-Off and use up/down arrows to move the head upper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are using the vinyl cutter with heat transfer paper, make sure the shiny part is down when you place it to the machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you stay right in front of the machine at all times when using the laser cutter. When I was printing with the laser cutter, I left the machine to take a look at the vinyl cutter (since it is only 1 meter apart, I thought it is totally fine), and I didn’t realize my cardboard was burning! Hopefully Tom was there to rescue the machine, but the bottomline is: you don’t know what can go wrong (and when it can go wrong), so always stay with the machine when printing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
