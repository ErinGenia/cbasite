I spent a few months, a few months ago, making plywood furniture. One of the 'pieces' was a set of stackable shelves:

These brought me great joy and turned out to be wicked useful, so I am here to revisit the project. In light of everything-going-really-fast all the time, I think doing things twice is nice.<br>
<br>
I want a cardboard variant of the same stacking system, and I want to make the sizes modular and parametric: modular so that I can build cases of them, and parametric so that I can have varying levels of organization-granularity. Anyone who is familiar with these awesome u-line boxes knows what I'm talking about.<br>

When I made the plywood shelves, I did a little bit of anti-CAD - I used a notebook page to think through all of my cuts (table saw and router only) and my constraints (I had five 5x5' sheets that I wanted to more or less dice-up evenly). I 'stuck to the medium' ... i.e. normally when we do design, we are tempted to go through really high levels of abstraction before arriving back at the actual-thing (i.e. modern BIM in architecture)<br>

Instead I wanted to stick to 2D. Parametricism here is nice, and useful, and required, so I'll let that in. But I wanted to make an exercise of this where I did all design work using only the 2D, unfolded representation of my box.<br>
<br>

I got a sense for things and laid out a plan... a box with no top, that stacks, and is reinforced with a fold on most edges.<br>

Parametric drafting to get my thicknesses, fold allowances etc set up... and to do some head scratching.<br>

In an ideal world, or one where I am more organized, this step (cleaning lines up / organizing layers in Rhino) wouldn't exist. But here we are.<br>

I got a line of these out, each time going back to Fusion, adjusting as I saw necessary, and coming back. I'm satisfied with the direction, and I have the 'last version' still to cut. I spent some time figuring out how to make the folds happy, and slowly getting tabs etc into the right place. I wrote a tiny grasshopper script to generate score patterns.<br>

I should explain: these will stack. Like This.<br>
