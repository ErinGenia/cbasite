<p>My Fav Screensaver<br>
<br>
I wanted to get to know the Vinyl Cutters - machines I have never thought were terribly useful, but are remarkably well engineered (look at that linear rail! AT-profile belt! woo!).<br>
Neil mentioned Kiragami, though, a totally worthwhile thing, and one of the reasons I kick myself for not learning more mathematics.<br>
<br>
In any case, I made a sticker. The Vinyl Cutter Killer App.<br>

I inspected (shift+ctrl+i on most browsers) the CBA logo on mods.cba.mit. Turns out it's written directly into the page as an SVG HTML Tag. I copy + pasted that into Sublime, saved it as an SVG and opened that in Illustrator. Lo-and-behold, I had the vector I was looking for! This was trivial-seeming but a 'wow' web-tech-doing-things-well moment for me. Neat.<br>

I made a brick-style pattern in Illustrator and spread it across a sheet that was just a bit larger than my laptop. Turned out to be just right.<br><br>

First thing, these features were just under the size I would say is comfortably-cut on the Vinyl Cutter. Someone with more patience than me probably could, but ... I am not that person.<br>
Second thing, I thought I would be able to register the Red Dots in the Blue Dots in one sheet. Tom Lutz showed us how to do this with bigger images, which was totally cool - but I did not think for long enough about the mechanics of this on a small scale.<br><br>

I ended up cutting out each pair of Red-Dots and placing them by hand. A moment of zen, but not the best way to do this.<br><br>

Me, fanboy? no...<br><br>
