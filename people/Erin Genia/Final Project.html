        <h1> Morningstar Design Color Chooser and Projector </h1>
        <p> As a creator of Morningstar-patterned artwork in textiles and other media, I have found a color visualization and selection to be a challenge. It’s time consuming to draw and color paper templates in order to configure a successful color scheme for a design. I would like to create an app that would allow you to choose from an array of colors to help the user decide how to arrange the colors in the starburst design. If there was an accompanying LED projection unit that could be programmed from the app to reflect the color choice to project the colors, it would help the quilter get a sense of scale and also be a beautiful ambient light source.</p>  <p>Week 1 Update: </p>
<p> This week I have been challenged to learn html coding. I’ve done lots of reading, watched many tutorials, made many mistakes, and asked for help. I’m still far away from fluency in this new language. This makes me wonder whether the learning curve is too steep to be able to accomplish the app part of my final project.</p>
