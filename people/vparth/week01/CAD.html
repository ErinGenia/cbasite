	<h2>CADDing my Final Project idea</h2>

	<p>
		<p> After working in the Augmented Reality and Holography space for a litte while, I thought it would be neat to make my own AR prototype glasses using holograms.
			Imaging a future where can do true 3D object rendering right in front of you and walk around the object in your room. Or watch a realistic capture of the SpaceX rocket launch from your coffee table. </p>

		<p> I designed the laptop side pieces, support, and top structure in Fusion 360. </p>

		<p>For modularity, I designed other tops that fit with the stand for various applications. One would be an insert allow for a heat sink. </p>

		<p>In my first iteration I made the notches too large for the cardboard(0.25in) and then reduced them to 0.15in (or 3.9mm).</p>
