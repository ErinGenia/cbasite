				<h2>What am I going to do and why?</h3>
			<p>
				I worked on working on a shoe rack. The image below tells more than 1000 words why I decided to do so. </p>

				As I started tackling the project I decided to start playing around with Solidworks and after some head-banging I discover a  functionality that made my life easier: mirroring.  </p> I have to thank a good tutorial at lynda.com see <a href="http://lynda.com.mit">here.</a>
				</p> I debated over whether I should use flexures and the sheet metal option, but perhaps that could have been more than I could chew this first project. So at the end I made up my mind to use a very simple structure with the following pieces</p>
				<p><IMG SRC="img/Piece1.png" ALT="Pieces" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128></p>
				<p><IMG SRC="img/Piece2.png" ALT="Pieces" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128></p>
				<p><IMG SRC="img/Piece3.png" ALT="Pieces" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128></p>
			</p>
				It looked good afterwards</p>
				I still have to home my designers' skills and, goes without saying, also the maker skills. But overall, this project was an excellent start.
