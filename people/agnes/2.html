    I've always been fond of the russian painter Kasmir Malevich. I thought that re-creating his most famous work <em>'Black Square'</em> (it's a black square) might be a bit of a cop out, and I was interested to try and work with multiple colours. 
    
    <div id="imgBlock">
    <img src = "assets/img/2/malevich-aeroplane-flying.jpg">    
    <img src = "assets/img/2/ai-trace-malevich.png">
    </div>
    
    Here I used adobe illustrator to trace the painting <em>'Aeroplane Flying'</em>, shown above in the original and traced form, with different colours separated into layers.
